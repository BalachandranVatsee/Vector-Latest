<br><br>
Cookies set by the website are called “first-party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website you are visiting are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

                            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. There are other similar technologies like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables recognition of a visitor to a website or opening of an email by them. This allows, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to understand whether the visitor has come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

                                                Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. There are other similar technologies like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables recognition of a visitor to a website or opening of an email by them. This allows, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to understand whether the visitor has come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
